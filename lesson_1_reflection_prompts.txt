How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I should to able to access all the histrory versions when even ever I required to check the changes and enhancements and modifications.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    If we manually commit then we can easily seperate the logic for each commit.But if its automatic then it create lot of committs even for small changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Generally we update multiful files while working in the project to make the feature complete.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    with the git log we can find all the commits information and with the git diff we can compare the changes in two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It giving more confident because if anything happen wrong I can revert my changes.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Add the code, remove the code, modify the code...etc.
